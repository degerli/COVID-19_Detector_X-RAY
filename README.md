# COVID-19_Detector_X-RAY
I have developed an AI model to combat and understand the coronavirus (COVID-19) which affects the whole world currently. My CNN model, which I use various datasets to train it, can detect COVID-19 with chest X-RAY pictures. I hope to develop the precise model as the data in my hand increases day by day.

Codeblock is created by me!
# Technology
Google colaboratory environment is used.
Keras, Tensorflow are used.
CNN is used.
Binary classification is used. 

# Summary
The model is detecting covid-19 from previous patients' chest x-ray images.
